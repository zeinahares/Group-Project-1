Explore the grandeur of CineFile, engross yourself with all the details you love about every movie out there and impress your friends with all of your movie knowledge. Save all of your favorite movies, never lose your Search history as its saved for you (unless you delete it...), and enjoy becoming the greatest movie buff out there!

If you search a movie title, you will recieve a list of all movies containing that string. If you click on a movie title, you can open a new page to view more information about that movie. Once you search, your search history is saved for future reference. If you click on the search history element, it will take you to your list of movie search.

If a movie interests you and you would like to save it, press on the heart button underneath every movie title. Now, youre movie is saved and printed to the shortlist and the heart button is red. If you accidentally pressed the button and saved a movie, just press it again and it will remove it from the list. j If you leave and come back, the red heart will be there waiting for you! If you have watched a movie or no longer like it, you can remove that specific movie from your list. If you want to start over, just clear all!

If you're using the website from a phone, don't worry! Your shortlist will be waiting for you at the bottom of the page. Just press the new shortlist button in the nav bar to head on over there (no need to scroll all the way!).
